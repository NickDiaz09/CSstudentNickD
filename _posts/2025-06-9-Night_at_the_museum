## Sharing My Game with the World (or at Least My School)

Last week, I got to do something I’ve never done before—present a video game I helped build at a school event called *Night at the Museum*. It wasn’t a huge expo or anything like that, but it meant a lot to me. This was the first time I had the opportunity to show something I worked on in front of real people, outside of the classroom.

The event was designed to highlight creative projects from students across different subjects—art, history, science, and more. Our class, which focused on coding and game design, had a booth where my group and I were able to showcase the game we’d been building for weeks. It was exciting, nerve-racking, and honestly—pretty awesome.

## Behind the Screens: Building the Game

Our game wasn’t made overnight. It took weeks of coding, testing, debugging, and plenty of teamwork. I worked with a group of friends and classmates, and we each brought something different to the table. Some of us handled JavaScript programming. Others worked on character design, sound effects, and layout.

We used HTML5 and JavaScript to build the core of the game, creating our own functions, animations, and even dynamic elements like menus and victory screens. It wasn’t easy. There were days when nothing worked the way we wanted, and bugs showed up out of nowhere. But we kept pushing, and eventually, the game came together into something we were really proud of.

## Preparing to Present

A few days before the event, we practiced how we’d explain the game to people who might not understand coding. We created a small info sheet to lay next to our station with quick bullet points about the game’s mechanics, inspiration, and how it was made. We also ran through different “what if” situations—like what to say if the game crashed or someone asked us a tough question.

Our teacher gave us a few tips about keeping our explanation simple and focusing on what made our game special. That helped me a lot because I tend to talk in too much detail when I’m excited.

## Game Time: Night at the Museum

The event started in the early evening, and the school was buzzing. Students, teachers, and parents wandered from station to station, checking out different projects. When people started coming up to our table, I felt a little nervous, but that quickly turned into excitement.

Some people asked how we made the characters move. Others were interested in the JavaScript code behind the scenes. A few kids sat down and started playing right away, giving us real-time feedback as they jumped, dodged, and tried to win.

One of the best moments was when a younger student, maybe a 5th grader, beat the first level and yelled, “This is so fun!” That made all the hard work worth it.

## What I Learned

This experience taught me a lot. Of course, I learned more about coding and game development, but I also learned how to explain my work clearly, how to answer questions on the spot, and how to handle the nerves that come with presenting something personal.

I also saw how important teamwork is. Our game wouldn't have been half as good if we hadn't communicated, listened to each other's ideas, and helped each other fix bugs and test everything. Presenting with my group reminded me that good projects usually come from good collaboration.

## Looking Ahead

Now that I’ve had this experience, I’m even more motivated to keep building games and learning more about how to improve. I want to take on bigger projects in the future—and maybe even present at bigger events or competitions. For now, though, I’m just proud of what we accomplished and grateful I had the chance to be part of it.

Night at the Museum wasn’t just a school event—it was my first real step into the world of game design. And it felt great.
